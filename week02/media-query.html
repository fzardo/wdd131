            <h2>1 Nephi 3: 7</h2>
            <p>
                And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded,
                for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that
                they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.

            <h2>Moroni 10: 3-5</h2>
            <p>
                Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them,
                that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down
                until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts.
                And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ,
                if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ,
                he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.
                And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things.
